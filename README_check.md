This project implements a recommendation service API that provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for product recommendations. The service is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

## Overview

This service allows users to interact with recommendations in an online shopping environment. Recommendations can be created, retrieved by ID, updated, and deleted. The `/service` folder contains the `models.py` file for the recommendation model and `routes.py` file for the service endpoints.

## Automatic Setup

The best way to use this repo is to start your own repo using it as a git template. To do this just press the green **Use this template** button in GitHub and this will become the source for your repository.

## Manual Setup

You can also clone this repository and then copy and paste the starter code into your project repo folder on your local computer. Be careful not to copy over your own `README.md` file so be selective in what you copy.

There are 4 hidden files that you will need to copy manually if you use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to copy files from this folder into your repo folder.

These should be copied using a bash shell as follows:

```bash
    cp .gitignore  ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .flaskenv ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .gitattributes ../<your_repo_folder>/
```
